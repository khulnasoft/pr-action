## Self-hosted PR-Action

- If you self-host PR-Action with your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) API key, it is between you and the provider. We don't send your code data to PR-Action servers.

## PR-Action Pro ðŸ’Ž

- When using PR-Action Pro ðŸ’Ž, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Action Pro will use KhulnaSoftâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” PR-Action will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## PR-Action Chrome extension

- The [PR-Action Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-action-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) will not send your code to any external servers.
